# Roadmap / next items

This is the “what’s happening now” tracker for the next local iteration:

1. Confirm command-line UX docs against actual CLI binary output during release packaging.
2. Add short examples for Windows service/packaging and environment-specific startup.
3. Add developer-only docs for test data, mock provider behavior, and endpoint payload examples.
4. Add endpoint payload samples once API contract is final for Alpha 2.
