# Alpha Build 1 — VoiceType2 execution docs

This folder contains the first focused implementation documents for `VoiceType2`.

- [`alpha-build-1-api-construction.md`](./alpha-build-1-api-construction.md): how to build the first API runtime and wire services end-to-end.
- [`alpha-build-1-cli-orchestrator.md`](./alpha-build-1-cli-orchestrator.md): how to build the first CLI orchestrator against that API.

Use this set as the default “day-one build pack” before adding tray/frontend orchestrators.
